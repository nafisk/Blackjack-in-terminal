# Blackjack - freenome

## Getting Started

No outside dependencies are required. To run the game, go to the project folder and then run the following command.

```
python3 Main.py
```

## Assumptions
While planning and designing the game with the requirements given, there are some topics that came up that I made some educated guesses and assumptions on for better practices and for future implementations
- The code should be able to handle multiple players with little adjustment to the main game loop
- Scores need to be recounted each time it is displayed to get the most optimized value due to the 1 or 11 case instead of having a stored value to call
- Scores values of each card could change in the future, so store and read it from a json file to be able to edit it easily
